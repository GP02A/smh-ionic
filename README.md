# smh-ionic

This is the cross platform port (built with Ionic) of my single page web app for tracking sea monster hunting guild quest in BDO.

You could find the origin spa built with vue.js [here](http://bologs.gp02a.com/tools/smh-timer), and the web app (built with Ionic + React) this cross platform port [here](http://bologs.gp02a.com/spa/smh-ionic). Android apk for testing purpose can also be find in the [Releases](https://github.com/GP02A/smh-ionic/releases).

##Instructions
The app is build with Ionic. There are many different options to test native functionality depending on your target platforms and needs, please refer to Ionic's [offical doc](https://ionicframework.com/docs/developing/previewing) for more information.

The app has been tested on web and android (API level 21 or greater, meaning Android 5.0 and up), but not on iphone, as I don't own a device that can run xcode. To test it on IOS, please refer to [Capacitor iOS Documentation](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/ios).
